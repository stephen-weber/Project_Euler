C++ and Python solutions to ProjectEuler.net Computer Problems

Current Update is that I have 160 problems solved. Ranking me in the top 99.4%

Several solutions are missing still. The code wasn't saved.

I have several problems in both c++ and python, depending on my need for speed often enough.

Some graphical problems I coded a python script in Maya to create a visualization.
